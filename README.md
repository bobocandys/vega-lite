# Vega-Lite - Projections

## Team Members
Youying Lin - liny33

Vivek Paramasivam - paramv

## Two-Part Project
Our work involved changes to both Vega-Lite as well as Vega. Our Vega modifications are available here: https://github.com/bobocandys/maps

## Research and Development
As both team members are new to the Vega and Vega-Lite codebase, we are grateful for the assistance from the Vega-Lite Developers at the University of Washington Interactive Development Lab. The scope of our project, and much of the  development process would not have been possible without their input.

## Team Roles
As an undergraduate researcher at the UW Interactive Data lab, Youying was our primary contact with the Vega-Lite developers. Due to the complixeity of the existing Vega and Vega-Lite codebases, Vivek and Youying decided the best way to tackle these tasks are by pair-programming as much as possible, while relying on Youying's contacts at the IDL.

## Contribution
Our contribution to Vega-Lite is the capability to project geographic data in the form of latitude and longitude onto a specified map projection, such as the Mercator or Hammer projections. In addition, we added a [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) tile layer plugin to Vega which allows for visualization of detailed geographic information without the need for additional user-supplied data. The Vega-Lite contributions are housed in this repository, while our Vega plugin contribution is housed in our secondary repository [here](https://github.com/bobocandys/maps).
